# IBM MAS Connector for Envizi

The **IBM MAS Connector for Envizi** is released under the name "MAS Connector for Envizi". This connector supports the following capabilities through an App Connect flow:

-Automatically synchronize Asset location and meter readings from MAS to Envizi to automate tracking of energy usage and calculating its related scope 1 and 2 emissions of Electricity, Natural Gas, and Water.

***

## Use Case Examples

Corporate sustainability managers can gather and maintain accurate sustainability data for their portfolio of assets directly from Maximo where those assets are managed. Location data from Maximo serves as a baseline for all other Sustainability reports in Envizi; continuously updated meter readings data captured in Maximo (Electricity, Gas, Water) enables accurate GHG accounting and performance reporting in Envizi.

***

## Connector Architecture

**IBM App Connect** provides a flexible environment for integration solutions to transform, enrich, route, and process business messages and data. 

**App Connect Flows** enable specific integration use cases by connecting to predefined APIs to route and map data. Mapping has been pre-defined, but it can be customized.

**Native API framework** is used for Maximo and enabled thorugh provided packages that can be imported.

HEADERS | Replace the `YourAPIKeyHere` with the App Connect flow's API Key. Do not remove `,Content-Type:application/json`
HTTPMETHOD | Do not change the default value **POST**

<img width="946" alt="End Points - Configuration" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/5787e680-f7dd-11ec-93af-d44216ffbf86">

*End Point Configuration Page*

#### Cron Tasks

The integration is equipped to export Locations and Location Meter Readings out of Maximo. As part of the PLUSZEXPORT cron task, there are four individual cron tasks that are configurable- two for Locations and two for Meter Readings. These are the Always-on Cron Task and the On-Demand Cron Task.

##### Always-on Cron Task
This is for pulling the live or recent data from Locations and Meter Readings, and is supposed to be run frequently. This will pull the data that has come into the system after the last time it ran.

Based on its running frequency, the system will automatically decide the window of dates/timestamps to pull the data from.

These Cron Task Instances will use the suffix `_ALWAYS_ON`

<img width="360" alt="Cron task instance - always on" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/27732000-f7aa-11ec-82f3-0b1e39ea5c02">


##### On-demand Cron Task
Even though this is a Cron Task, this is supposed to run just once, on-demand, when the user wants to pull data between fixed dates/timestamps. Once the first cron event executes, it should be stopped in order to prevent the same data getting pulled again and again. 

_This is a stop-gap for now as we dont have another way from Maximo to call a preconfigured API on-demand._

This might be needed during initial setup of the system, as the Always-on Cron will start pulling data that has arrived after it has been started. This can also be used anytime in the future if there is any need to pull any historical data on-demand.

The start date (`OVERRIDESTARTDATE`) and end date (`OVERRIDEENDDATE`) have to be configured before the cron is started. 

These Cron Task Instances will use the suffix `ON_DEMAND`

<img width="356" alt="Cron task instance - on demand" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/6e611580-f7aa-11ec-80ac-5378b76aa2a9">


##### Basic Cron Task Parameters

- `MXURL`: The base URL of the Maximo instance. This would include the protocol, domain name and the port number. Do not put a trailing `/` at the end. In the absense of port number, the default port for the protocol will be used _(80 for http, 443 for https)_.
    - e.g. http://example.maximo.com:9080

- `CUSTOMER`: Name of the customer. This will be used to name the CSV files. To be supplied by Envizi.

- `OVERRIDESTARTDATE`: _(Only for On-demand Cron)_ The start timestamp of the window between which the data will be pulled from.
    - The date must be specified in ISO 8601 format.
    - e.g. `2022-06-26T23:09:30-07:00` where `-07:00` represents timezone offset of UTC-07:00 hours
- `OVERRIDEENDDATE`: _(Only for On-demand Cron)_ The end timestamp of the window between which the data will be pulled from.
    - The date must be specified in ISO 8601 format.
    - e.g. `2022-06-26T23:09:30-07:00` where `-07:00` represents timezone offset of UTC-07:00 hours


##### Advanced Parameters

These will be set to the right values by default. **DO NOT** change these parameters without consulting with Envizi.

- `SELECT`: Names of the fields from the Object Structure
- `FROM`: Name of the Object Structure
- `WHERE`: _(Optional)._ OSLC Condition for data selection
- `ORDERBY`: _(Optional)._ Sequence by which the data should be pulled
- `TARGETDATECOLUMN`: Name of the DateTime Column in the Object structure that will be used to filter records between a date-time window.
- `SAVEDQUERY`
- `ENDPOINTNAME` - Name of the Maximo End Point configured to connect to the AppConnect flow.
- `PAGESIZE` - Maximum number of records pulled from Maximo in one API call. This will also be the maximum number of records in the CSV file.

##### Configuring Cron Task

1. In the Maximo menu, click on **System Configuration > Platform Configuration > Cron Task Setup**
<img width="638" alt="Cron task - Menu" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/204c1200-f7aa-11ec-902b-56a6cacbbbb1">

- Under the **Cron Task** column, type **PLUSZ** and hit enter to search
<img width="754" alt="Cron task - Search" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/375131/files/217d3f00-f7aa-11ec-8d77-1339ac049a2d">

- Click on the **PLUSZEXPORT** Cron Task
- In the Cron Task Instances, click on the Schedule/Calendar icon to set the schedule for the Cron Task Instance
- Once it is configured, click on **OK**
- Select the Cron Task Instance to configure Parameters
- Scroll down to the **Cron Task Parameters** section and configure the **Value** column as needed. Ideally, only the `CUSTOMER` and `MXURL` parameters will need to be edited for all instances. For the **On-demand** Crons, the `OVERRIDESTARTDATE` and `OVERRIDEENDDATE` parameters will need to be edited.
- Click on **Save**

## Part 3: Testing

To test that the configuration is complete, send a test payload in order to test connectivity.

1. Go to the **End Points** application and click **Test** at the bottom of the PLUSZExport end point.
- Send a test payload that is a valid object. ```{"Hello":"World"}``` would work.
- If the response is anything other than **Bad Request**, see [what might be causing the error](#troubleshooting)

## Troubleshooting
 
When testing that the end point is entered correctly on the **End Points** application, there are a few common errors:

Error | Cause | Resolution
 -- |-- |--
Response code received from the HTTP request from the endpoint is not successful | Invalid URL in the Integration Object | Double check the URL that all of the components are entered correctly. Make sure there are no accidental spaces at the beginning or the end in event of a copy/paste.
404: Not Found | Flow is not Running | Make sure the flow is Running before starting the cron tasks
PKSync error| Certificate error | Confirm the certificate is configured correctly


## Reference for Pre-requisite

### **Pre-requisite: Pre-check that Data is correct**

*Data for Location Meter will not be exported to Envizi if the Unit of Measurement is not configured.*

The current integration with Envizi only supports the following Units of Measurement for the Location Meter data:

Meter Type | Supported Unit of Measure
-- | --
Electric | GJ, kWh, MWh
Natural Gas | GJ, MJ, kWh, m3, mmbtu, therms
Water | litres, kliter, m3, gallons

If these Units of Measure are not present on the instance of Maximo, they can be added in the **Item Master** application under **Inventory** on the drop down menu.

Select **Unit of Measure and Conversion -> Add/Modify Units of Measure** and add the missing units.

<img width="800" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-16 at 6 31 58 PM" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/0570811c-9472-4bb8-9208-9d20d50f78fe">

A Service Address must be configured in Location with the following fields for proper functioning of Envizi's features:

- Street Address
- City
- State
- Post Code
- Country
- Latitude
- Longitude

If the Location does not have a Service Address, navigate to **Address Information** under the Location and either select or create an associated Service Address.
